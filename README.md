# DelhionEngine (WIP)

# What is DelhionEngine
DelhionEngine is a 3D real time rendering engine written in C++, based on OpenGL. Currently this is NOT a game engine just a rendering engine. In the future I want to expended it to a high visual game engine but currently this is just a rendering engine.

Tech I use:
- OpenGL
- GLFW
